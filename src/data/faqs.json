  {
    "question": "What technologies do you specialize in?",
    "answer": "I design and develop modern, responsive, and user-centric web interfaces using the Next.js ecosystem. With strong expertise in TypeScript and the App Router architecture, I focus on creating smooth user experiences, reusable component systems, and visually engaging designs that scale beautifully across devices."
  },
  {
    "question": "What kind of projects have you built?",
    "answer": "I've built several production-grade applications including a fliz multilingual website and shadipros and speakfeed, a full-stack eCommerce platform, and a blog system. My projects are built with modern technologies like React, Next.js, and Node.js, and follow best practices in performance, security, and user experience. I focus on creating responsive, accessible, and scalable web applications that solve real-world problems."
  },
  {
    "question": "Do you have experience with DevOps and Deployment?",
    "answer": "Yes. I move beyond basic deployments by using Docker to containerize applications, ensuring consistent environments from development to production. I implement Multi-Stage builds to optimize image sizes (reducing my latest app to ~276MB) and set up automated CI/CD pipelines on platforms like Render."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you ensure code quality and stability?",
    "answer": "I enforce a strict quality standard using Husky, ESLint, and Prettier for pre-commit checks. Beyond syntax, I use Docker to prevent 'it works on my machine' issues, and I strictly validate all data using Zod to ensure type integrity across the full stack."
  },
  {
    "question": "Are your projects mobile responsive?",
    "answer": "Absolutely. I follow a mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI. I rigorously test across devices to ensure seamless UX, maintaining 90+ Lighthouse performance scores even on mobile networks."
  },
  {
    "question": "How do you optimize application performance?",
    "answer": "Performance is a priority. I use TanStack Query for aggressive caching and Next.js Server Actions to minimize client-side JavaScript. I also optimize Docker images for faster cold starts and implement debouncing and code-splitting to keep the application lightweight."
  },
  {
    "question": "What is your approach to security?",
    "answer": "I believe in security by design. I implement HTTP-only cookies for session management, use Bcrypt for password hashing, and protect API routes with Middleware. I also ensure strict environment variable isolation to keep production secrets safe."
  },
  {
    "question": "What are you currently learning or improving?",
    "answer": "I am currently focused on advanced Engineering best practices. I am diving deeper into Unit Testing with Jest/React Testing Library to ensure rock-solid reliability, and I am exploring System Design patterns to build even more scalable architectures."
